# Wiretap

**Modular synth patch language for humans and LLMs.**

Use the Wiretap spec as context to prompt patch ideas right from the model. Generate patches using basic synthesis concepts and brand-agnostic modular building blocks, creating a document that is half score and half technical specification.

There is a child spec, Talisman, that takes a Wiretap patch and turns it into glyphs for use in compact visualizations and conceptual art.
