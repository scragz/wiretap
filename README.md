# Wiretap

**Modular synth patch language for humans and LLMs.**

Use the Wiretap spec as context to prompt patch ideas right from the model. Generate patches using basic synthesis concepts and brand-agnostic modular building blocks, creating a document that is half score and half technical specification.

*[Talisman](https://github.com/scragz/wiretap/blob/main/spec/talisman.md) is a child spec of Wiretap designed to create visual representations, taking a Wiretap patch and turning it into glyphs for use in compact visualizations and conceptual art.*
